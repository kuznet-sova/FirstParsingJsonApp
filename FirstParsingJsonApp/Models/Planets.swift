        "A misty, tranquil planet that has recently attracted the wrong kind of attention. Athenas is mostly uninhabited, save for a sect of monks known as the Order of the Impending Storm who have made their home in the high peaks of the mountains. What secrets do they guard here, inside ancient walls that were built long before humans set foot on Athenas?",
        "A backwater swampland of a planet, and family home of the Jakobs clan. Eden-6 is covered by lush greenery and stagnant waters, dotted with occasional settlements and the rusted hulks of crashed spaceships. Civilization has never fully taken hold here, and indigenous dangers including ravenous Saurians and semi-sentient Jabbers effectively rule the planet. As if you didn't already have enough to worry about, the Children of the Vault have a presence here as well.",
        "The unrelentingly harsh frontier planet of Gehenna is dangerous as all hell, and twice as brutal. Once used as a long-gone company's testing ground for prototype weaponry and biological experiments, these dusty wastes and cut canyons are now lorded over by genetically modified beasts and their keepers, a vicious gang calling themselves The Devil Riders. Descendants of the old company folk who stayed behind work hard to carve out a peaceful existence for themselves, but these days, their chances of survival seem slim.",
        "Somewhere in a long-forgotten region of uncharted space lies Nekrotafeyo, the fabled homeworld of the lost Eridian civilization. Though their monuments and relics still stand, their original purposes are lost to time, ancient riddles carved from stone and light. Strange native predators and Eridian Guardians are all that are left behind, but that won't stop Maliwan from sending their elite forces to try and control the planet's ruins and natural resources.",
        "Balanced precariously between two black holes, The Handsome Jackpot is an opulent space station casino that has been on lockdown since the death of its owner, the infamous Handsome Jack. The once-thriving destination, packed with luxuries and attractions worthy of his lavish lifestyle and dirty dealings, is now home to an army of Hyperion security bots on high alert and debt-crazed casino-goers who are trapped on board.",
        "A barely-habitable rock that the Children of the Vault have made their homeworld. Pandora's searing-hot deserts, vicious wildlife, and burgeoning bandit population have proved too much for all who have tried to tame the planet and exploit its resources. The ruins of Dahl, Atlas, and Hyperion facilities litter the landscape, inhabited by all manner of Skags, Rakk, Varkids, and Spiderants that are intent on eating and killing you. Usually in that order.",
        "Home to the Atlas corporation headquarters, Promethea is a metropolitan world covered in futuristic towers of chrome and glass. A recent siege by Maliwan has turned the urban environment into a warzone; their mechanized infantry patrol the streets, rodent/insect hybrids known as Ratches infest the sewers and back-alleys, and the Children of the Vault are seizing the opportunity to recruit displaced and disgruntled citizens. Atlas CEO Rhys Strongfork is getting desperate.",
        "Few willingly choose to live on this harsh, windswept ice world, and those that do must deal with mutated rock slugs, ferocious wolven, and other terrifying creatures with teeth and tentacles aplenty. Scarier still is the otherworldly horror that once lived here, its colossal carcass vast enough to shelter a town in amid its tentacles. There, occult devotees rule with eldritch powers gained from the monster’s corpse itself. An unlikely venue for a destination wedding, the frozen landscape of Xylourgos is not for the faint of heart."
